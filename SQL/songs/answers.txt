To calculate the "Audio Aura" of the listener. I might take a simple approach as such:
1. Extract the key attributes (energy, valence and danceability):
    I might decide to get an average of these attributes to estimate the user's aura.
    ENERGY:
        High (0.700 - 1.000) may be linked to an intense mood (Orange or Purple)
        Medium (0.400 - 0.699) may mean a calmer, introspective or motivational mood (Yello or Green)
        Low (0.000 - 0.399) may suggest a more emotional or romantic mood (Blue or Pink)
    VALENCE (Positivity):
        High (0.700 - 1.000): may be linked to a hopeful mood (Yellow, Pink, Purple)
		Medium (0.400 - 0.699): A mix of both positive and melancholic moods (Green, Orange)
        Low (0.000 - 0.399): suggests somber or introspective feelings (Blue)
    DANCEABILITY:
        High (0.700 - 1.000): suggests the listener prefers lively music (Orange or Purple).
		Medium (0.400 - 0.699): a balance between danceable tunes and complexity (Green or Yellow).
        Low (0.000 - 0.399): shows less danceable, more emotional or ambient music (Blue, Pink).
2. Pair the Results together to create a final category. Like so:
    +------------+------------+------------------+-----------------------------+--------------+
    | Energy     | Valence    | Danceability     | Mood Description            | Aura Color   |
    +------------+------------+------------------+-----------------------------+--------------+
    | High       | High       | High             | Bold, confident, joyful     | Orange       |
    | High       | High       | Medium           | Energetic but focused       | Yellow       |
    | High       | Medium     | High             | Bold with balanced emotions | Green        |
    | High       | Low        | High             | Intense but somber          | Purple       |
    | High       | Medium     | Medium           | Dynamic yet thoughtful      | Green        |
    | Medium     | High       | High             | Motivated and joyful        | Pink         |
    | Medium     | High       | Medium           | Uplifting but relaxed       | Yellow       |
    | Medium     | Medium     | Medium           | Calm and introspective      | Green        |
    | Medium     | Medium     | High             | Fun and engaging            | Orange       |
    | Medium     | Low        | Low              | Reflective and emotional    | Blue         |
    | Low        | Medium     | Low              | Wistful and melancholic     | Blue         |
    | Low        | Low        | Medium           | Romantic and dreamy         | Pink         |
    | Low        | High       | Low              | Hopeful but subtle          | Yellow       |
    | Low        | Medium     | Medium           | Gentle but impactful        | Green        |
    +------------+------------+------------------+-----------------------------+--------------+

For instance: This user has an average energy of 0.65906(Medium), and average valence of 0.484443 (Medium)
    and an average danceability of 0.71646 (High). Therefore, their audio aura is Orange.


WHY THIS APPROACH MAY NOT BE FULLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE USER'S AURA?
1. Seasonal variation is lost when summarizing the user's aura.
2. A few extreme values may skew the final result and make it less accurate.
3. Mood miht also be influenced by the lyrics, tempo or genre of the music listened to.

IMPROVED METHOD TO CALCULATE THE AUDIO AURA MORE ACCURATELY
1. Weighted averages based on how frequently the songs are played.
2. Seasonal clustering of the auras rather a yearly summary.
3. Mood Clustering on energy, valence, danceability, and other features to identify multiple mood clusters.
4. Inclusion of other attributes such as tempo, loudness, genre, and speechiness.
